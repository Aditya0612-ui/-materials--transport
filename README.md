# Dashboardproject1

This is a minimal Vite + React scaffold created in your workspace.

## Quick start (Windows PowerShell)

```powershell
# 1) Install dependencies
npm install

# 2) Start dev server
npm run dev
```

Open the URL printed by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173).

If you want me to run `npm install` and start the dev server now, tell me and I'll run those commands for you.
